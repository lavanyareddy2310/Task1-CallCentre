# Problem Statement :

In this project Create a dashboard in Power BI for the call center manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

Possible KPIs includes:

* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

* The average satisfaction rating has decreased over the span of three months. January brought the highest satisfaction rating and march the lowest.
* The percentage of issue resolved in January was the highest, with a dip in February. It increased again in march.
